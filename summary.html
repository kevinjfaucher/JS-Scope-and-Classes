    1. Lexical Environment:

    It's the local environment for a block of code (a function or any other block like a loop or conditional).
    Variables in this environment are scoped to that block.
    
    When code runs, it first looks for variables in the immediate block, then looks 
    outward (parent scope), and continues until it reaches the global scope if necessary.

    2. Closures:

    A closure is when an inner function "remembers" its surrounding lexical 
    environment even after the outer function has finished executing.
    
    The closure preserves the variables in the outer environment so that 
    they can be used later by the inner function.
    
    It doesn't save the parent function’s code, only the variables 
    (and their values) that were in the parent's scope.

    3. Inner Function Access:

    The inner function can access variables from the saved lexical environment later.
    However, the inner function can only access what it was already coded to access
    before it was returned or used later.
   
    If the inner function was designed to use a particular variable from the parent
    environment, it can access it. Otherwise, it's not accessible.

    4. Returning Variables:

    If the inner function is returned, it can access variables from 
    the parent’s lexical environment.

    However, the parent’s variables are only accessible through the 
    inner function (closure), unless the variables themselves were returned directly.
